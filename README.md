# Spelling Bee Training Tool

My elementary school daughter recently came home after competing in her schools spelling bee. In the excitement of the moment of having faired so much better than last year she said next year I want to win! 

That inspired me to see if I could design a tool to help her prepare. 
# See my first planning on Trello:
[Public Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/TF8kdi5t/spelling-bee-practice-app)

## Current plan and goal:
* ability to reveal the word after trying to spell it first
* [ice box] have app listen (and recognise) spelling
* enlarge vocabulary to practice as student progresses
* setting for practicing 'older' already learned words for review
* setting for learning just new words
* graphical display of progress?
* create way of tracking how well a word has been learned

## Next (first steps)
* grade level appropriate word lists to practice
* word definitions in style of spelling bee
* determine MVP goal

## Completed steps
* create wireframe
* create data models
* determine MVP goal
* have app speak words to student
* study mode
* spelling bee mode
* admin panel to add words

I struggled to figure out how to animate the letters on the flashcard in study mode. I thought it would be a great bonus if the letters would be emphasized as they are spelled my the computer. I found these helpful links from Sarah L. Fossheim. I adapted them to make it work for the study mode: <br/>
